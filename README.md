Corpus choice: Playlist 
Creating playlists is a fun way to switch up your musical taste, interest and keep the entertainment to the highest level. As someone who gets tired of songs, easily creating various playlists helps me to jump between my playlists and switch up the mood. In my opinion, playlists help you maximize the enjoyment of songs while setting the right atmosphere and mindset. On the other hand, playlists save you time in various situations like study playlist, workout playlist, meditation playlist, morning playlist, party playlist etc. 
The natural groups in my corpus are people, genres, artists and albums. My expectations are as follows. I believe there will be a positive correlation with albums and genres. Negative correlation between people and genres, as individuals tend to have several playlists across genres. Negative correlation between people and artists, the probability of an individual listening to one artist is very unlikely. 
One of the features Spotify provides is enhancing your playlist automatically on free plan and gives you the option to enhance your playlist with songs that are in similar genres as the songs in the playlist. This feature has its benefits and flaws. With the free plan you have no option other than have your playlist edited without your choice, with the paid plan you can undo this feature and the accuracy of this feature to match your musical taste is questionable. 
Typical tracks in my corpus can be classical songs combined in a "study playlist" or rap/hip hop songs grouped together for a "workout playlist".
